# The-Beninese-Collegiate-Programming-Contest


The Beninese Collegiate Programming Contest is a competition that pits teams of 2 or 3 students from universities in Benin against each other. During this competition you have to solve about ten algorithmic problems in 5 hours. After the 2020 edition, my team finished second and consequently vice-champion of Benin. 

Here I present you the problems and solutions of the different problems we solved.

You can also consult the explanations of the solutions on my [blog](https://samirmaoude.github.io).
